The first week of Metis Data Science Bootcamp was definitely an eye-opener! Having not been living in the Bay Area since high school, it was definitely a change from what I was used to. Aside from the t-shirts, backpacks, and laptops everywhere, the pure interest and level of technological prowess was astounding. Even the ads at the train station were regarding machine learning.

Everyone in the class had a variety of backgrounds, but everyone seemed smart and could catch on to what was being taught. I was definitely glad that I did the prework for the class, since I feel that helped me a lot the first week.

Pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn are very useful and I'm very glad I learned them. I feel that these packages could definitely help my old company analyze and look at data much more quickly.

Applying Python to Project Benson was definitely cool. It was great doing data munging on real MTA turnstile data. We then took Uber pickup data from Github and tried to categorize each Uber datapoint to a certain MTA station. The messiness of this data was the most difficult part. Trying to clean data is a long and arduous task. Eventually, our results pointed to some stations that did not have lots of Uber pickups, which we thought was a great conclusion for our projects. This meant that we could use data science to find locations for a competitor company to place drivers!

We covered a lot during the first week, and this is just a small glimpse of what we did. Hopefully the second week will be just as fun!
